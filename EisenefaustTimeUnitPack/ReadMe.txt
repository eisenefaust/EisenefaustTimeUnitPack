My attempt at implementing a Time Unit like mechanic into the game.

1) Converting all of the base game from AP->TU. This would probably work by vastly increasing the amount of AP in the game. 90 AP at the beginning of each turn, 25 to shoot, etc). Also preventing any ability from ending the turn
2) Changing movement to use AP (TU) for distance traveled
3) Make an ability that converts leftover AP to ReserveActionPoints at the end of the turn (simple)
4) UI changes. You'd probably need a mouse floater to track the amount of AP a move would take (difficult? idk) and a numerical value under the health bar (simple)
5) Stretch goals would probably involve difficult mobility options and soldier stances/animations (crouch/prone).
